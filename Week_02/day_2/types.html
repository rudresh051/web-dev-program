                    Main article: Utility cycling
                    Utility cycling refers both to cycling as a mode of daily commuting transport as well as the use
                    of a bicycle in a commercial activity, mainly to transport goods, mostly accomplished in an
                    urban environment.</li>

                    Bicycles are used for recreation at all ages. Bicycle touring, also known as cyclotourism,
                    involves touring and exploration or sightseeing by bicycle for leisure. Bicycle tourism has been
                    one of the most popular sports for recreational benefit.[30] A brevet or randonn√©e is an
                    organized long-distance ride.</li>

            <li><strong>Organized rides</strong>
                    Many cycling clubs hold organized rides in which bicyclists of all levels participate. The
                    typical organized ride starts with a large group of riders, called the mass, bunch or even
                    peloton. This will thin out over the course of the ride. Many riders choose to ride together in
                    groups of the same skill level to take advantage of drafting.</li>

            <li><strong>Mountain</strong>
                    Mountain biking began in the 1970s, originally as a downhill sport, practised on customized
                    cruiser bicycles around Mount Tamalpais.[32] Most mountain biking takes place on dirt roads,
                    trails and in purpose-built parks. Downhill mountain biking has just evolved in the recent years
                    and is performed at places such as Whistler Mountain Bike Park. Slopestyle, a form of downhill,
                    is when riders do tricks such as tailwhips, 360s, backflips and front flips. There are several
                    disciplines of mountain biking besides downhill. Cross country, often referred to as XC, all
                    mountain, trail, free ride, and newly popular enduro.</li>

            <li><strong>Racing</strong>Cycle sport is competitive physical activity using bicycles. There are
                    several categories of bicycle racing including road bicycle racing, time trialling, cyclo-cross,
                    mountain bike racing, track cycling, BMX, and cycle speedway. Non-racing cycling sports include
                    artistic cycling, cycle polo, freestyle BMX and mountain bike trials. The Union Cycliste
                    Internationale (UCI) is the world governing body for cycling and international competitive
                    cycling events. The International Human Powered Vehicle Association is the governing body for
                    human-powered vehicles that imposes far fewer restrictions on their design than does the UCI.
                    The UltraMarathon Cycling Association is the governing body for many ultra-distance cycling
                    races.

                    Bicycle racing is recognised as an Olympic sport. Bicycle races are popular all over the world,
                    especially in Europe. The countries most devoted to bicycle racing include Belgium, Denmark,
                    France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland. Other countries with
                    international standing include Australia, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom and the United States.
