                Vehicles for human transport that have two wheels and require balancing by the rider date back to the
                early 19th century. The first means of transport making use of two wheels arranged consecutively, and
                thus the archetype of the bicycle, was the German draisine dating back to 1817. The term bicycle was
                coined in France in the 1860s, and the descriptive title "penny farthing", used to describe an "Ordinary
                Bicycle", is a 19th-century term.

                <li>1817 to 1819: the draisine or velocipede.The first verifiable claim for a practically used bicycle belongs to German Baron Karl von Drais, a civil servant to the Grand Duke of Baden in Germany.

                <li>1860s and the Michaux "Velocipede" or "Boneshaker".The first really popular and commercially successful design was French. An example is at the Museum of Science and Technology, Ottawa

                <li>The safety bicycle: 1880s and 1890s.The development of the safety bicycle was arguably the most important change in the history of the bicycle. It shifted their use and public perception from being a dangerous toy for sporting young men to being an everyday transport tool for men—and, crucially, women—of all ages.

                <li>21st century.The 21st century has seen a continued application of technology to bicycles (which started in the 20th century): in designing them, building them, and using them. Bicycle frames and components continue to get lighter and more aerodynamic without sacrificing strength largely through the use of computer aided design, finite element analysis, and computational fluid dynamics. Recent discoveries about bicycle stability have been facilitated by computer simulations.[48] Once designed, new technology is applied to manufacturing such as hydroforming and automated carbon fiber layup. Finally, electronic gadgetry has expanded from just cyclocomputers to now include cycling power meters and electronic gear-shifting systems.
