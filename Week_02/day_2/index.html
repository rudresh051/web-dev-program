                Vehicles for human transport that have two wheels and require balancing by the rider date back to the
                early 19th century. The first means of transport making use of two wheels arranged consecutively, and
                thus the archetype of the bicycle, was the German draisine dating back to 1817. The term bicycle was
                coined in France in the 1860s, and the descriptive title "penny farthing", used to describe an "Ordinary
                Bicycle", is a 19th-century term.
